### Description

The Linear Motor Invention Kit consists of a series of mechanisms and activities centered around a reconstruction of the Charles Page “Electromagnetic Engine” patented in 1854. This work was undertaken in consultation with the curators at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History. The original patent model housed in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution was used as a reference for the modern-day reconstruction.
